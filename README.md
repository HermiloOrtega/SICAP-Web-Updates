# üì¶ SICAP Updater

## üß≠ Overview
**SICAP Updater** is a Windows application developed in C# to automatically synchronize operational data from the [**SICAP**](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/SICAP) to [**SICAP Web**](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/SICAP-Web) and [**SICAP Indicadores**](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/SICAP-Indicators).

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality
- **Automated Scheduled Updates**:
  - Background service automatically updating KPIs and summary tables daily.
  
- **Manual Update Trigger**:
  - Manual update button available for urgent refresh needs.

- **Error Handling & Logging**:
  - Error capture with full detail (function, module, user, timestamp, exception message).
  - Logs saved for later troubleshooting and analysis.

- **System Tray Application**:
  - Runs quietly in the background.
  - Notification alerts in case of success, errors, or interruptions.

- **Secure Environment Selection**:
  - DEV, QAS, or PRD database environment selectable from the login interface.

- **Single Instance Enforcement**:
  - Ensures only one active instance runs on the system at any time.

- **Startup Integration**:
  - Configured to auto-launch on system startup ensuring 24/7 availability.
